            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Whitewater rafting has a rich history that dates back thousands of years. The earliest evidence of
                rafting can be traced to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians and Mesopotamians, who used
                rafts made from reeds and other natural materials to navigate rivers for transportation and trade.
                In the modern era, whitewater rafting as a recreational activity began to gain popularity in the
                mid-20th century, particularly in the United States. The sport has since evolved with advancements
                in equipment and safety measures, making it accessible to a wider audience. Today, whitewater rafting
                is enjoyed by adventure enthusiasts around the world, offering thrilling experiences on rivers of
                varying difficulty levels.
